    "## **1. Hypothesis** ü§î:\n",
    "Increasing the mutation rate might lead to faster initial improvements in the car's performance but could eventually hinder the convergence to an optimal solution, causing the performance to plateau or even deteriorate.\n",

    "**Outcomes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first graph Performance *Before* Adjusting Mutation Rate shows a steady increase in performance with the original mutation rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second graph Performance *After* Adjusting Mutation Rate shows three scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low Mutation Rate (green):** Performance increases slowly, reflecting a more cautious exploration of the solution space.\n",
    "- **Medium Mutation Rate (orange):** Performance sees a faster initial increase but then plateaus. This represents a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "- **High Mutation Rate (red):** There's a rapid initial increase in performance due to aggressive exploration, but it's followed by a decline, indicating potential erratic behavior or loss of optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Results](results.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Discussion** üßê:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low Mutation Rate**: The graph indicated that a low mutation rate led to a steady, albeit slower, increase in performance. This suggests that while it may take longer to find optimal solutions, the solutions found are more consistent and stable. The gradual exploration of the solution space helps in honing in on optimal strategies without too many diversions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **High Mutation Rate**: The rapid initial increase followed by a decline in the graph suggests that while a high mutation rate can lead to quick initial gains, it may also introduce a lot of suboptimal changes. This erratic behavior indicates that the algorithm is exploring a vast range of solutions but struggles to consistently refine and hold onto the best ones.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Medium Mutation Rate**: The medium mutation rate showed an initial rapid increase, similar to the high mutation rate, but then plateaued. This suggests that it strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation, initially seeking out a broad range of solutions and then refining the promising ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Conclusion** üéØ:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mutation rate plays a pivotal role in the evolutionary process. While a high mutation rate accelerates initial exploration, it may struggle with consistent long-term improvements. On the other hand, a low mutation rate ensures steady progress but may take longer to achieve peak performance. The medium mutation rate seems to offer a middle ground, capitalizing on the benefits of both rapid exploration and consistent exploitation. Therefore, selecting the right mutation rate is crucial for optimizing performance."
