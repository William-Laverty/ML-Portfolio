# üöÄ Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the repository containing a collection of machine learning projects. This repo demonstrates the power and versatility of machine learning across various domains, from predicting student performance to landing a spacecraft safely on a lunar surface.

## üìò Projects

### 1. Student Performance Predictor

Predict student performance using the Linear Regression technique. The goal is to forecast the final grades of students based on various academic and socio-economic factors.

- **About**: This algorithm uses the "student-mat.csv" dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). The dataset contains information about student performance in mathematics.
- **Details**: Dive deeper into this project by exploring [`gradePredictor.ipynb`](https://github.com/cgs-ist/student-grade-predictor-William-Laverty/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/gradePredictor.ipynb).
- **Key Features**: Command-line interface (CLI) version for grade predictions, comprehensive data analysis, and visual insights.

### 2. Lunar Lander Performance Predictor

Train a spacecraft to safely land on a lunar surface using a Deep Q-Network (DQN).

- **About**: The project uses the `LunarLander-v2` environment from OpenAI's gym to simulate the challenges of landing a spacecraft on the moon.
- **Details**: Dive deeper into this project by exploring [`LunarLander_Predictor.ipynb`](https://github.com/cgs-ist/student-grade-predictor-William-Laverty/blob/main/Reinforced%20Learning/LunarLander_Predictor.ipynb).
- **Key Features**: Real-time spacecraft visualization, DQN implementation, and success metrics.
